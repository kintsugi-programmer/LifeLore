import Link from 'next/link';
import Image from 'next/image';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { signIn, signOut, useSession, getProviders } from 'next-auth/react';
import React from 'react';


To roll back to the specific commit 4e527db and make it final on the main branch, follow these steps carefully:

Step-by-Step Instructions
Open your terminal and navigate to your repository's root directory.

Reset your main branch to the specific commit using the --hard option. This will discard all changes made after the commit 4e527db:

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard 4e527db
Force push the changes to the remote main branch to ensure that the remote repository reflects this reset. This will overwrite the history on the main branch on the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main --force

nav

const isUserLoggedIn = true; is a good technique
later make auth


route.js auth making api endpoints backend

# LifeLore

Lifelore is a platform where users can share life values, lessons, and advice across various fields. Built with modern web technologies, Lifelore aims to create a community-driven repository of knowledge and experiences.

LifeLore is a Next.js application designed to allow users to share and discover life lessons. The platform features a modern design with glassmorphism trends and provides a comprehensive CRUD system for managing Advices. It uses MongoDB for data storage and NextAuth for authentication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data and Advices.
- **NextAuth**: Authentication library for securing user login with Google.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.

## üîã Features

- **Modern Design with Glassmorphism Trend Style**: A sleek and contemporary design using the glassmorphism trend for an appealing user interface.
- **Discover and Share AI Advices**: Users can explore Advices shared by the community and create their own.
- **Edit and Delete Created Advices**: Users have the ability to edit or delete their Advices at any time.
- **Profile Page**: Each user has a dedicated profile page showcasing their created Advices.
- **View Other People's Profiles**: Users can view profiles of other creators to explore their Advices.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A "Copy to Clipboard" feature for users to easily copy Advices.
- **Search Advices by Specific Tag**: Search functionality to find Advices based on specific tags.
- **Google Authentication using NextAuth**: Secure Google authentication for a streamlined login experience.
- **Responsive Website**: Fully responsive design to ensure optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## ü§∏ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git**
